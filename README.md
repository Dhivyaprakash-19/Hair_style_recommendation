# Hair_style_recommendation
Overview

This project is a computer vision-based hairstyle recommendation system that detects a user's face shape and suggests suitable hairstyles. The system utilizes Dlib's shape_predictor() to identify 68 facial landmarks and classify the face shape into categories such as oval, rectangle, square, and circle. Based on the detected face shape, the system recommends the best hairstyle options.
